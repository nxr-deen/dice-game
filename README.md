# 🎲 Dice Game

A fun and simple dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Two dice are rolled using `Math.random()`.
- Images change dynamically to reflect the dice roll.
- The player with the higher number wins!
- If both players roll the same number, it's a draw.

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` – The main structure of the game.
- `style.css` – Basic styling (if included).
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic for rolling dice and updating the page.
- `images/` – Folder containing dice face images (`dice1.png` to `dice6.png`).
